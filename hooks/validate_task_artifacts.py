"""Validate dynos-work task artifacts deterministically.

Usage:
  python3 hooks/validate_task_artifacts.py .dynos/task-YYYYMMDD-NNN [--no-gap] [--use-receipt]

  --no-gap        Skip the plan_gap_analysis pass. Use this from execute
                  preflight when planning has already validated the same
                  plan — saves up to ~2000 file reads per call.
  --use-receipt   Skip ALL validation if a fresh plan-validated receipt
                  exists with matching artifact hashes. The receipt is the
                  proof that planning already validated the same artifacts.
                  Falls through to normal validation if no fresh receipt.
