"""TDD-first tests for claude-md-auditor ensemble=false (task-20260430-008).

The haiku→sonnet→opus ensemble cascade exists for auditors whose
verdicts vary across model tiers. claude-md-auditor's verdict comes from
``hooks/lib_claude_md.py`` (deterministic AST/glob analysis surfaced as
structured JSON); running three sequential model tiers against the same
deterministic input is pure waste. With high risk_level the cascade
otherwise fires by default (router.py:992-994).

This test suite drives the contract: claude-md-auditor must always
emit ``ensemble: false`` in the audit plan, regardless of:

  - risk_level (high/critical otherwise force ensemble=true)
  - sampling roll (medium/low otherwise CRC32-sample)
  - fast_track flag (already false-correct)
  - any future ensemble_auditors override that includes claude-md

Other deterministic-first auditors that may exist (none today, but
the design must support them) join via the
``_DETERMINISTIC_FIRST_AUDITORS`` set.

Other auditors are NOT affected. security-auditor and db-schema-auditor
remain in _DEFAULT_ENSEMBLE_AUDITORS and continue to run the full
cascade by default.
